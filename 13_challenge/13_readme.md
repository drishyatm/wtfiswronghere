The error message showed as line number 17 and pointed towards fizz and could see that single quote is missing in one side . 
Corrected the line 17 for missing quote 
three_mul = 'fizz', 
throws another error . 

Syntax error in line 23, and the point is towards the end of the statement . 
Corrected the syntax for the range by adding the colon 
for i in range(1,max_num):
produced another error . 

NameError in line 34 , and could see that the name is fizzbuzzy .
Corrected the name fizzbuzz(100) and it worked .
