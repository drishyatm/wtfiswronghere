Error shows the line numbers as 15 and 26 and mentioned about integer argument expected and got string. 
The argument passed was in line 26 , hence edited fizzbuzz(16) and it worked . 
As per the description it says , numbers between 1, 99, hence we need to pass the number 100 . hence edited it to  fizzbuzz(100)
